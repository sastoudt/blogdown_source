<i>Miscellaneous Coding Projects </i>
<br>
<br>

<a href="https://github.com/datadesk/census-data-aggregator">Census Data Aggregator</a>: While at the Los Angeles Times Data Desk, I worked to add functionality to the Census data aggregator, an open source Python library that helps aggregate data from the census while still accounting for margin of error. 
<br>
<br>

<a href="https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/from-base.html">stringr Vignette</a>: I wrote a vignette to help users transition from performing string operations in base R to using the tidyverse stringr package. 


<a href="http://wealthtaxsimulator.org/simulator_app/">Wealth Tax Shiny App</a>: UC Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman analyzed Senator Elizabeth Warrenâ€™s proposal for a wealth tax, and Fernando Hoces de la Guardia from the Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS) wanted to turn their work into an open policy analysis (OPA). I created the interactive visualization portion of this project.

<a href="https://highschool.latimes.com/whitney-high-school/metro-plans-to-increase-access-to-public-outdoor-spaces/">Travel Time to Greenspaces</a>: I helped Riona Sheik crunch some numbers to supplement her story on access to public outdoor spaces via public transportation in Los Angeles (check out the plot).
<br>
<br>

<a href="https://github.com/cabinetofcuriosity/coc_lewis_clark_workshop/"> Cabinet of Curiosity </a>: I play a supporting role in Ciera Martinez's natural history data <a href="https://curiositydata.org"> project </a>. She works with students to make natural history data acessible and visible to data scientists.
