<p>I learned R before the tidyverse (shout out to <span class="citation">@BaumerBen</span>’s Multiple Regression class Fall 2016) and have failed to update my skills. There, I said it. I’m a statistics PhD student whose code is riddled with dollar signs (<em>pull</em> Sara!) and the occassional loop that I’ve never wrangled into a proper apply statement (which should now be switched to <em>purrr</em>?). And although I have picked up some <em>ggplot2</em> and <em>dplyr</em> (I’m not THAT much of an R hermit), I really don’t know what new functionality is available. This prevents my code from keeping up with the times. It has always been on my to-do list to work through the tidyverse documentation so that I can start using the packages in my own work, but I’ve always prioritized “done” over “pretty”.</p>
<p>But no longer! My plan of attack is to start blogging about my tidyverse immersion, one package at a time. Each week(ish) I will read up on a tidyverse package and ideally, update some gross code from one of my current or previous projects, showing the before and after. Maybe I’ll aim to post on Monday’s… #MakeoverMonday anyone?</p>
<p>What do I need to master?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/">Core Tidyverse</a></p>
<ul>
<li>ggplot2: #TidyTuesday is going to be super helpful for this.</li>
<li>dplyr</li>
<li>tidyr</li>
<li>readr</li>
<li>purrr</li>
<li>tibble</li>
<li>stringr</li>
<li>forcats</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/robinsones/rstudio-conf-2018-talk/blob/master/Rstudio_conference_2018_presentation.pdf">Extras</a></p>
<ul>
<li>readxl, haven, jsonlite, xml2</li>
<li>httr, rvest</li>
<li>lubridate, hms</li>
<li>blob</li>
<li>rlang</li>
<li>magrittr</li>
<li>glue</li>
<li>modelr</li>
<li>broom</li>
<li>lobstr</li>
<li>sf</li>
<li>bookdown, blogdown</li>
<li>reprex</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a lot of weeks! So why am I doing this now?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Hadley Wickham gave a <a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/events/using-visualisation-understand-r-theory">talk</a> in our department recently, and I was one of the lucky five to have lunch with him beforehand. He mentioned that failing to update one’s R skills is like never updating R and RStudio versions (I’m occasionally guilty on this front as well, but let’s deal with one character flaw at a time).</p></li>
<li><p>When I was trying to help students at UC Berkeley’s third annual <a href="http://ftp.stat.berkeley.edu/">DataFest</a>, I realized the students didn’t know what I was talking about when I was describing how I would approach a coding problem. I needed a tidyverse translator!</p></li>
<li><p>I’m trying to be more open about my work (<a href="https://github.com/sastoudt">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sastoudt">Twitter</a>), and there is only so much embarassment I can take.</p></li>
<li><p>If not now, when?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>So stay tuned, and hold me accountable.</p>
<p>Advice? Solidarity? Let me know! (<span class="citation">@sastoudt</span>)</p>
<p>Special thanks to <span class="citation">@dpseidel</span> for giving me feedback while I was drafting this post (and telling me to <em>pull</em> not <em>select</em> instead of <em>$</em>, see I’m learning already!).</p>
